					"description": "Whether your project is big data or enterprise integration, Spring XD makes it easy to solve common big data integration problems such as data ingestion and export, real-time analytics, and batch workflow orchestration.  In this workshop we will cover stream creation, batch job execution and high availability.  You will learn how to create streams to capture live data from various sources (hdfs,tcp, no sql, RDBMS), filter and modify the data as well as capture counts then output this data to various sinks (hdfs,tcp, no sql, RDBMS).  Also covered is how to create batch workflow solutions that span traditional use-cases such as moving data between flat files and relational databases as well as Hadoop use-cases.\r\nThe best news is that you don't need to code anything up to get going, no build scripts, no IDE, no maven coordinates.  If you are working on a big data, Spring Integration, Spring Batch project this workshop is for you.  This is a hands-on workshop so bring your laptop!",

The changes include APIs like JAX-RS 2, JMS 2, Java Batch, Java EE Concurrency, WebSocket, JSON-P and JSF 2.2. The workshop will introduce these changes in a step-by-step fashion using a realistic end-to-end application deployed on GlassFish 4 using NetBeans.\r\n\r\nAlthough the primary focus will be on the new APIs and features, we will take a holistic approach to the workshop and also cover the features introduced in Java EE 5 and Java EE 6 such as the ones in EJB 3, CDI, JPA, Bean Validation and JSF focused on annotations, intelligent defaults, type-safe, powerful, fluent APIs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the workshop, you will have a broad introduction to Java EE 7 and will be ready to write your own applications having already written quite a bit of code in the workshop.",

Well there is no better way to learn a new paradigm than by actually seeing it implemented.  In this workshop we'll take a working code example and transform it into the functional paradigm all in Java 7.  We'll step through everything from higher-order functions, function purity and even to some levels of immutability.  At the end, we'll show how we can make use of Java 8's lambdas by very simple changes to the code that we've already refactored.\r\nAt the end, you should be able to take the concepts that you learn from this workshop and start using them the next day at work!",

					"description": "\r\nComponent-oriented UI development has been popular for over twenty years, with the introduction of Visual Basic. The promise is simple: packaged reusable code that makes powerful widgets like grids, toolbars, menus, smart input controls, panels, media players, charts, graphs, trees, image viewers, and so on, easy to integrate into applications.\r\n\r\nOn the web, frameworks such as ASP.NET, JSF, Tapestry, Wicket, GWT, and Vaadin take advantage of component architectures, and there is no shortage of JavaScript/HTML5 widget libraries such as YUI, KendoUI, jQuery UI, Bootstrap, ExtJS, and so on. Each of these frameworks allows developers to build their own custom components, but those components won’t work outside of the framework. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a standard way to build a UI component that runs in a browser? A component model that is part of the open web?\r\n\r\nFinally, there is: Web Components, an emerging standard from the Web Applications Working Group (WAWG). Web Components consists of five different standards: Templates, Decorators,\r\nCustom Elements, Shadow DOM, and Imports. Together, these standards allow you to build custom widgets with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS that can be used just like native HTML elements.\r\n\r\nSince the standards are not fully supported in all browsers, you need a library to support them in non-compliant browsers. Google’s Polymer does just this, and more.\r\n\r\nCome to this workshop to learn about these exciting new technologies hands-on.",

					"description": "Agile works great, when it works. It tends to be most successful in small companies, with small teams that can work completely independently of others. It tends to fail when more teams are involved, when there are dependencies between them. Even though we're \"doing Scrum\", it still just doesn't yield the promised benefits. When agile fails it can be disappointing and costly. People get blamed, agile gets blamed, the training gets blamed, and the organizational culture gets blamed. Yet companies keep trying. Many companies make multiple attempts to transition to agile because they've bought in to the underlying principles of agile and see it as a solution to their problem hitting dates, their long time to market, their slow return on investment, and their quality problems.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll examine 8 causes for Agile's failure in large enterprises, and why starting a transformation with culture or even practices isn't the solution. We'll examine why the ultimate solution begins with putting in place the certain organizational structures and planning a journey through predictability on our way to adaptability. Specifically, to begin we need a thoughtful mix of product or feature teams and component or service teams, as cross functional as practicable in each instance; agile structures above the team; and appropriate agile governance at the portfolio and program management layers. This creates an environment in which agile can begin to stick, can begin to deliver value, and creates a platform from which we can move on to increased agility.",

The scope of content spans from a development environment to a hybrid PaaS, and how Containerization is an enabler of architectural choice, innovation, scalability, and polyglot solutions.\r\n\r\nThe basics of Docker will be examined including repositories, brief discussion about managing and monitoring Docker containers, service discovery, and security.  New and emerging technologies will be a constant theme, particularly about microservices, in addition to the ongoing evolution of the market and what the future may bring.  Common organizational issues (and tactical solutions) that may impede successful decomposition and migration of legacy monoliths will be discussed, including security, DevOps and refactoring.\r\n\r\nHypothetical architectures will be described for building progressively more robust and complex applications and deployment models.  The goal is to highlight the power, flexibility and scalability that containers enable.  \r\n\r\nExamples will start simple, from a local development environment, that is a simple two container setup that encapsulate a database and application tier.  Subsequent discussion will involve progressively more complex and robust deployments that include features such as service discovery, automatic load balancing, and abstractions to simplify linking of containers including service gateways.

					"description": "More than 55 years ago John McCarthy had an insanely great idea called Lisp. Lisp marked the beginning of functional programming, interpreters, high-level metaprogramming, garbage collection, and much more. Yet after such auspicious beginnings the idea of Lisp has since faded and many of its innovations have been adopted by much more popular programming languages. Until recently Lisp even appeared doomed to fade into obscurity but several things have conspired to make Lisp somewhat cool again - one of these is Clojure, a fun modern Lisp targeting the Java Virtual Machine.\r\n\r\nHowever the Web doesn't speak JVM bytecodes. It speaks JavaScript - thus the cornucopia of languages that now compile to JavaScript. The most well known include GWT, CoffeeScript, and more recently Dart and TypeScript. However none of these represent a real break from the status quo.\r\n\r\nJohn McCarthy's insanely great idea still has a lot to offer the Web and we'll see how with ClojureScript, an implementation of Clojure that targets JavaScript.",

These features are great, but is that enough information to make the change to Lisp style syntax and a functional paradigm?\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide a big picture view, with examples of many of the features that make Clojure so powerful: Immutable values, powerful collection types, interop with Java or JavaScript, Go style channels, polymorphism, and being able to interact with running programs through a REPL. There will also be discussion of a number of pain points that can make it hard to get started with Clojure, and how to overcome them.\r\n",

These are just a few issues that can cause serious bottlenecks in page load times. Having a faster load time equals better search engine rankings, higher conversion rates, and an overall reduction in bandwidth costs. How do we measure all the aforementioned performance killers? How can we bring these measurements into our automated build process to ensure that our site is getting better, and not worse?\r\n\r\nPhantomJS, a headless WebKit with JavaScript API, gives us the ability to create lightweight performance measurement tools with JavaScript (and so much more). In this talk we’ll review how PhantomJS has influenced some of the web’s top ranking sites and how it can be put into any automated build to produce reporting on performance. We’ll look at how other open source projects such as WebPageTest.org measure up to this approach and see when one might be better over the other.",

We'll examine the entire lifetime of a failing project: we’ll look at the leading indicators of danger so we can identify them sooner, we’ll discuss common root causes and mitigation strategies so we can deal with them more effectively, and we’ll propose some follow up strategies, so we can recover from organizational, technical, and cultural damage as soon as possible.",

You'll learn how even a little bit of customer interaction can lead to huge insights... and then you'll learn how to interpret those insights and incorporate them back into your Agile project. \r\n\r\nInformation for Review Team: \r\nIn the first activity, the participants will play the role of the customer. I guide them through a couple of exercises to create an outline of what customers need and want from a product. I’ll use an accessible example, like a web application for paying a bill online. \r\n\r\n1. In four or five areas around the room, put a piece of poster paper on the wall. \r\n2. Split the participants into groups.\r\n3. Have each group fill in boxes on the paper to describe the attributes of a particular kind of user but focus on the tasks that user needs or wants to accomplish (like a brand new user who needs to pay a late bill). This includes describing what helps or impedes them from doing their task. It also includes describing the user in useful ways (this person is typically early 20’s, in a hurry, has kids, etc.)\r\n4. Rotate the groups to add/subtract/move things from the previous groups list.\r\nOnce this is complete, I’ll demonstrate how this information can be used to create a “quick and dirty” persona, as well as describe how additional research can be combined with this activity to create a more formal persona.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’ll lead the participants through an activity where they play the role of the business trying to prioritize stories. I’ll show them how they can use the personas to help guide them and how to help avoid common the trap of thinking that just because they know the business intimately they automatically know what the customer would need or want. \r\n\r\nPrerequisite Knowledge: \r\nGeneral Agile knowledge, particularly SCRUM framework, is assumed.",

The Java DSL for Spring Integration is essentially a facade for Spring Integration. The DSL provides a simple way to embed Spring Integration Message Flows into your application using the fluent Builder pattern together with existing Java and Annotation configurations from Spring Framework and Spring Integration as well. While not requiring Java 8, the use of Java 8 Lambda expressions in the DSL makes for even more succinct configuration.\r\n\r\nThis session takes a deep dive into using the DSL to define a reasonably complex integration application. While concentrating on the use of Java 8 Lambda expressions we will also cover pre java 8 constructs for those users not yet ready to make the move.",

					"description": "For years, developers have tried to find an easier way to create mobile apps; they discovered hybrid mobile apps but soon found out that hybrid wasn’t ready for prime-time. Developers encountered problems with speed, building good-looking UIs, and a plethora of hardware differences that forced them to go back to the land of native development.  AngularJS changed the way developers built apps for the web, and now Ionic has changed the way developers build hybrid apps on mobile. \r\n\r\nEasy-to-use, beautiful, and ready to perform, Ionic is an open source framework made for hybrid apps. In this talk, see how to use AngularJS and how to supercharge it with Ionic to create an SDK for the web.\r\n",

Fortunately, with the new JavaFX ZombieTime app, powered by the JSR 310 Date and Time API, you can rest easy.  With built-in time zone and DST support you no longer have to worry about roaming around under the scorching hot sun.  Accurately calculate out how long you have to infect the villagers before you decompose using Durations.  And coordinate global attacks on the humans by syncing with your undead brethren on Instants.  With the power of Java 8, eradicating the human race with a highly infectious virus has never been easier!\r\n\r\nThis presentation is designed to teach Java Date and Time APIs to the undead, but the living are welcome to be our \"guests\".  You may also learn some JavaFX in the process -- that is entirely my fault.  Any correlation between the characters and events in this presentation and the impending extinction of mankind is purely coincidental.",

					"description": "Developers will often adopt a framework long before it is prudent, or will cling to a framework long after it has become irrelevant.  This phenomenon of picking and sticking with a framework for all the wrong reasons affects everything we do, from the estimates we give, to the people we hire, and the companies we want to work for.  Attempts to mitigate the risk of poor framework choices are often thwarted by the ability of a single developer to introduce a questionable framework that then gets adopted by their peers.  The effect is magnified by the fact that many developers would rebel and quit if they could not use their framework of choice.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore this phenomenon in an attempt to find it's root causes.  This meandering journey will take us down the dark paths of the recruiting industry's keyword obsession, academia's attempts to prepare graduates for the real world, as well as the natural human instinct to play with new and interesting things - regardless of the cost.   Once we understand the nature of the problem, an attempt will be made to identify potential solutions, from those as uninspiring as training courses to as extreme as weekend hackathons.   \r\n",

					"description": "With a fragile test suite, the Continuous Testing that's vital to Agile just isn't feasible. If you truly want to automate the execution of a broad test suite—embracing unit, component, integration, functional, performance, and security testing—during continuous integration, you need to ensure that your test suite is up to the task. How do you achieve this? This session will provide tips on ensuring that your tests are up to the task:\r\n•\tLogically-componentized: Tests need to be logically-componentized so you can assess the impact at change time. When tests fail and they're logically correlated to components, it is much easier to establish priority and associate tasks to the correct resource.\r\n•\tIncremental: Tests can be built upon each other, without impacting the integrity of the original or new test case.\r\n•\tRepeatable: Tests can be executed over and over again with each incremental build, integration, or release process.\r\n•\tDeterministic and meaningful:  Tests must be clean and deterministic. Pass and fail have unambiguous meanings.  Each test should do exactly what you want it to do—no more and no less.  Tests should fail only when an actual problem you care about has been detected. Moreover, the failure should be obvious and clearly communicate what went wrong.\r\n•\tMaintainable within a process: A test that's out of sync with the code will either generate incorrect failures (false positives) or overlook real problems (false negatives).  An automated process for evolving test artifacts is just as important as the construction of new tests.  \r\n•\tPrescriptive workflow based on results: When a test does fail, it should trigger a process-driven workflow that lets team members know what's expected and how to proceed. This typically includes a prioritized task list.\r\n\r\n",

					"description": "\"Wait, wait! Don't pwn Me!\" is a live, developer and security news game show that pits three developer luminaries against each other in a game of wits. Past participants have included Joshua Corman, Chris Eng, Space Rogue and Matt Tesauro. Host Mark Miller, selects topics from the week's developer and security news, posing the news items as limericks, fill-in-the-blank, and audience participation questions. The panel competes against each other, and the audience, for speed and accuracy when answering the questions.\r\n\r\nDuring the AppSec USA 2013 Conference, the RSA 2014 Conference and the 2014 AppSec USA, and the AppSec 2014 Europe Conference this was a rollicking, high spirited session, exposing the prevalence of developer and security issues highlighted in the main stream news. It demonstrates how hard it is to keep up to date, even for the experts. Audience members should come prepared as we test their knowledge against the panel, trying to determine what is real news and what is fake. \r\n\r\nThis is a fun filled session where panelists and audience members compete for prizes. It is sure to put you in a good mood for the rest of the conference.",

					"description": "Containers are enabling developers to package their applications (and underlying dependencies) in new ways that are portable and work consistently everywhere—on your machine, in production, in your data center, and in the cloud. And Docker has become the de facto standard for those portable containers in the cloud, whether you’re working with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure.\r\n \r\nDocker is the developer-friendly Linux container technology that enables creation of your stack: OS, JVM, app server, app, and all your custom configuration. So with all it offers, how comfortable are you and your team taking Docker from development to production? Are you hearing developers say, “But it works on my machine!” when code breaks in production? And if you are, how many hours are then spent standing up an accurate test environment to research and fix the bug that caused the problem?\r\n \r\nThis lab offers developers an intro-level, hands-on session with Docker, from installation (including boot2docker on Windows/Mac), to exploring Docker Hub, to crafting their own images, to adding Java apps and running custom containers. \r\n \r\nThis is a BYOL (bring your own laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop and be ready to dig into a tool that promises to be at the forefront of our industry for some time to come. Prerequisites for the session will be published at burrsutter.com and announced via Twitter @burrsutter prior to the session.  ",

					"description": "Hey lads, lemme tell ya a story.\r\nOnce upon a time, we're talking about the year 2001, a few people had an amazing idea. They were thinking about something that would change the world. It would make the world easy and give programmers almost unlimited power! It was simply referred to as JSR 107, one of the least things to change in the upcoming future. But those pals were way ahead of their time and nothing really happend. So time passed by and by and by and over the years it was buried in the deep catacombs of the JCP. Eventually, in 2011, two brave knights took on the fight and worked themselves through all the pathlessness, to finalize it in 2014. Lads you know what I'm talking about, they called it the \"Java Caching API\" or in short \"JCache\". Yes you heard me, a Java standard for Caching!\r\n\r\nA software system cannot possibly imagined without Caching today and it was time for a standard. No matter if you want to cache database queries, generated HTML or results of long running calculations, new systems have to reach a critical mass to be successful. Therefore caching becomes a First-Class-Citizen of application landscape, the principle of Caching First. JCache has grown for 13 years to it's final success and had an amazing Co-Spec-Lead, Greg Luck - the inventor of EHcache.",

Memory leaks are real (--Insert horror scream here--), and we must understand how these happen! \r\n\r\nIn this session we will go into how the JVM allocates and keeps \"things around\", and then how memory leaks are inadvertently created. Not just that, but we will also deep dive in how to find and fix these leaks by using Free tools like VisualVM. We will walk through Strong/Weak and Phantom references and review unintended leaks (like using anonymous inner classes that have strong references). If you program in the J2SE space, or if your are an Android app developer, or even a Java EE who has to do a lot of Session and/or Batch processing this session is for you!\r\n\r\nThe title is a reference to Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c1dqJPsSa4)\r\n\r\n",

					"description": " The developer community is doing work right now that is being used to write new W3C standards for web components. Think of encapsulation or OOP. Google's approach is Polymer, a library which provides a \"sugaring layer\" of features. Polymer is built on top of platform.js, which extends the functionality of your browser to include next-gen features required to run web components. Some of the new features involved include building modular elements inside of HTML Templates, support to write your own unique Custom Elements with custom named tags (eg. <fancy-button></fancy-button> could be functioning html), the Shadow DOM which protects styles from bleeding over, and Model Driven Views (front end to back end data binding). Google's Platform.js is also being used by Mozilla X-Tags. \r\n\r\n It is important to note that Polymer is forward facing only and does not attempt to conform to any sort of backwards compatibility; only the last two versions of any given browser are supported and there is no intention to appeal to previous standards. Polymer is not a programming language, it's just an opinionated library. The core polymer team are also key contributors to W3C's evolving standards for web components. Work being done now is for tomorrow's standard, so we can get a fresh perspective on how the web should work instead of simply conforming to legacy approaches.\r\n\r\nThe talk will include basic instructions for getting started with Polymer using NPM and Bower. We will discuss the role of web components in future standards. There will be a general outline of how Polymer and it's dependencies fits into the stack and what job each part of the stack preforms. \r\n\r\nWe will go over how to make custom elements so you can get started actually having fun with Polymer.",

					"description": "UX Designers like to think that the top navigation of a website is really important. It's a critical component to the User Experience...right?\r\n\r\nUXers internalize this belief, because they were raised on it. Before the web became interactive, it was information architecture that put UX designers on the map (or the job boards, rather). All those \"pages\" of static content had to be bucketed, filed, and organized. The navigation, with it’s top of the page prominence, was their claim to fame! But in our practice today, what is the very first thing that we hide when screen size gets tight?\r\n\r\nThe navigation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we are starting to see that users actually downright ignore the nav, even when it’s visible in all of its desktop,docked glory. Users go straight for the big shiny objects - the content on the page.\r\n \r\nSo, if we hamburgered our navigation on mobile, and people ignore it on desktop, how do we get people to flow through our site? Well, the content must become the navigation. This is where Object Oriented UX comes in.  OOUX helps create an efficient, elegant modular system.  UXers, designers, and developers reduce rework, and the end user will have a more consistent experience.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce OOUX, walk through examples, and show you how to incorporate it into your process.",

The standard is built on shadow DOM, customer HTML elements, HTML import and CSS sandboxing. While each of these is interesting by its own right, the combination of these tools has a potential to simplify web platform and empower developers building larger applications.\r\n\r\nThe value proposition is really close to that of component based frameworks like Vaadin: Make building good quality user interfaces easy with a powerful encapsulation. Are Java frameworks on a crash course with web components or could they complement each other?\r\n\r\nLet me present you A new research project that answers what Vaadin has to do with web components. Is Polymer related? How GWT fits in? Which is the right way to go - Java or JavaScript for the user interface layer? Or both?\r\n\r\nIn this session we will demo what Vaadin team has been building on top of web components standards for a while.

This talk will explore some of the differentiating and compelling features that Elasticsearch offers, as it becomes the defacto full-text provider for the enterprise. Deploying Elasticsearch is a trivial endeavor, but knowing how to configure your cluster initially for optimal performance, is an art. In this presentation, I will share much of what I've learned in deploying and scaling-out massive Elasticsearch clusters that were designed from the ground up, optimized for performance with a specific use in mind. Some of the topics covered will focus on optimizing clusters, organizing and retrieving data, disaster recovery, and avoiding failure and performance degradation in a running cluster. Common and not-so-common deployment scenarios will also be investigated, such as: Log aggregation, Full-Text search, and its use in a CQRS architecture.",

					"description": "Front-end web development is at an extremely exciting juncture. A plethora of new tools have emerged over the last years to deal with the ever growing complexity of front-end development in a multi device world.Sass is one piece of the front-end system; a powerful tool that has addressed the short comings of CSS by bringing programming concepts to front-end developers and designers. \r\n\r\nIn this session we'll cover the core Sass feature set from a practical, daily use perspective. The goal is to introduce you to Sass concepts so that you leave feeling more comfortable with Sass and walk away with new Sassy insights to take back to your team or solo-practice as well as techniques for improving your front-end development process. \r\n\r\n### Topics\r\n\r\n* Sass data types: variables, maps, and lists\r\n* Mixins, extends, and functions\r\n* Control directives\r\n* File organization: partials, nesting, @import\r\n* Sass ecosystem: extensions and the community\r\n* Sass and the Node.js/IO.js ecosystem, including Ruby Sass and Libsass \r\n\r\n**N.B.**\r\n\r\nLearning is best learned by doing. Exercises will be provided for you to follow along,. You don't need to have Sass running on your machine to participate. \r\n",

					"description": "You may think that just because you don't do any \"front end\" work, you don't need to worry about knowing how to design a good user interface. The truth is that you're designing user interfaces all the time - you just don't think of it that way. Just because you're writing code that doesn't include a GUI, don't think there isn't a user interface involved. An API is a user interface and many of the principles that go into designing a good GUI are just as applicable when creating the public interface for a package, a service, or even a single class.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you'll learn the fundamentals of good user interface design, techniques to help you deliver a great user experience, and how to apply them even when there's not a single pixel involved.\r\n",
